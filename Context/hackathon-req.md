From Idea to Onchain Reality
Join builders from across Indonesia to create the next wave of industry-defining onchain applications.
The Base Indonesia Hackathon 2025 (Dec 10, 2025 – Jan 31, 2026) is a hackathon designed to help teams turn ideas into real, functional onchain products—and accelerate Indonesia’s Web3 ecosystem.
Hosted and operated by BlockDevId, supported by Base, IDRX & Thetanuts Finance, this hackathon gives teams the resources, guidance, and momentum needed to build and ship.

Overview
This hackathon brings together Indonesia’s strongest Web3 builders to create impactful applications on Base. Over the course of several weeks, teams receive mentorship, technical support, ecosystem connections, and the opportunity to pitch live for 6,000 USDC in prizes.
Mission:
Build real onchain products that solve real problems—and push Indonesia’s onchain future forward.

Challenge Tracks
Participants will build solutions under two innovation tracks, each supporting different onchain use cases.
Your project must be functional and deployed on Base.
🟦 Base Track
